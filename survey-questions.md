1.  Do you know how to use the scoring system?
No, I use the call button to get an attendant or go up to the front desk and ask them to directly ammend the score.  Typically someone else on the team knows how to use the scoring system and will correct the score for me.

1.  If yes, how did you learn how to use it? What could have helped you to learn how to use the system?
It would be easier to learn the system if it was required to use the stystem for every game.  The system only needs human intervention once in a while when there's an error we need to correct.

1.  If no, why havenâ€™t you learned how to use it? Do you want to?
It's easier to ask an employee of the bowling alley to correct the score, if this wasn't possible I would be forced to learn the comptuerized scoring system.  Also, sometimes the bowling alley employee is required in addition to a computer correction, for example when there's dead wood and a score needs to be corrected.  Since they're at your lane, they retreive the lost pin and correct the score for you.

1.  If you could change the system, what would you like to do?
The buttons are on a heads-down keyboard while the screen is on a heads up display.  This makes it difficult to learn an unfamiliar keyboard and see the results on the screen.  There's a alot of abstraction like 4 cardinal direction arrows used to move around a 3d scene, for example selecting 10 pins.  A touch screen where the interace and the output display are the same would make learning this system much easier and some of the interactions more intuitive, for example I could just "touch" the pin I want to change instead of moving around with arrow keys to select it.
